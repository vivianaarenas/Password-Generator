# Password Generator

#Description

This password generator provides the user with an interactive experience that provides them the option of selecting either lowercase letters, uppercase letters, numbers and special characters for their brand new password. The password generator will then randomly generate a password between 8 and 128 characters. The user can feel free to refresh the page for different passwords. However, if the user inputs an amount not valid with the requirements, they will be unable to generate a password, and will need to refresh, and try again.
